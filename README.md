# Replicating the results of Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills
Reproducing the results of the Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills paper (ICLR 2020)

## Requirements
A dockerfile is present for use on systems with AMD GPUs - such as the RX Vega 56 used by one developer. Using this is entirely optional. The requirements are: 

* PyTorch
* MuJoCo 2.1
* Python (Miniconda or Anaconda is strongly suggested)

## Running on colab
For instructions on running MuJoCo on colab, see: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KGMZdRq6AemfcNscKjgpRzXqfhUtCf-V?usp=sharing
